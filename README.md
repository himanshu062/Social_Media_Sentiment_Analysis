# Social_Media_Sentiment_Analysis
 In this project, we aim to harness the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze sentiments expressed on social media platforms. Understanding the sentiment behind user-generated content can provide valuable insights into public opinion, brand perception, and emerging trends.
